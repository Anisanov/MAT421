For instance, finding the root for f(x) = x^2 - 1 is very simple and could be determined using analytical methods such as using the quadratic formula. However, finding the roots of f(x) = sin(x) - cos(x^2) is very difficult to find using analytical methods. So in this instance we may turn to numerical approximations."],"metadata":{"id":"hkoQWQfaSy1T"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","## Bisection Method\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NdpIuLdjT7i6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The bisection method for approximating zeroes is a very basic technique although very inefficient.
